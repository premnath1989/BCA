 * @author uko
 * @version $Name: RST#SignWare#core#REL-3-0-1-2 $
 * @brief SignWare Dynamic Development toolkit, tablet access
 *
 * This header includes all definitions for low-level tablet access
 * using the SPTablet object. SPTablet abstracts the tablet hardware,
 * it does not inteprete any tablet vectors e. g. to capture a
 * signature. Please see @ref SPGui.h for tablet access with
 * graphical representation.
 *
 * Acquiring a signature typically involves several steps:
 * -# Select driver with @ref SPTabletCreate
 * -# Register listeners with @ref SPTabletSetListeners
 * -# Connect to the tablet with @ref SPTabletConnect
 * -# Enter acquiry mode with @ref SPTabletAcquire
 * -# Process tablet vectors (samples) as they are sent to the listeners
 * -# Process the timestamp with @ref SPTabletGetTimeStamp
 * -# Exit acquiry mode when done by calling @ref SPTabletAcquireDone
 * -# Process the sample rate with @ref SPTabletGetSampleRate and the timestamp with @ref SPTabletGetTimeStamp
 * -# Disconnect from the tablet with @ref SPTabletDisconnect
 * -# Deallocate the SPTablet object with @ref SPTabletFree
 * .
 *
 * Some low-level drivers use windows messages to communicate
 * with the application. Wintab uses message ID's in the range
 * WM_USER + 0x7BF0 (0x7FF0) through WM_USER + 0xFBFF (0x7FFF),
 * the SOFTPRO drivers use message ID's in the range
 * WM_USER + 0xFBD0 (0x7FD0) through WM_USER + 0xFBDF (0x7FDF).
 *
 * Please assure that these message ID's do not conflict with message
 * ID's in your application.
 *
 * SPTablet normalizes the data passed from different tablets, applications
 * will not have to care about the attached device. The normalisation
 * covers:
 *      - pressure: all pressure levels are normalized to a range 0 ... 1023
 *      - coordinates: all coordinates are transformed according to the
 *        specified resolution [in DPI]
 *      - background images: images are scaled to fit the display device (if applicable)
 *      .
 * Tablet vectors are passed to registered listeners with normalized pressure
 * and coordinates.
 *
 *
 * @section sec_TabletStatusChanges Tablet Status Change Notifications
 *
 * Some tablet drivers cannot execute status changes synchronously but have to
 * dispatch the status request and perform the requested operation later. This 
 * applies e. g. to TabletPCs, which cannot directy enter acquiry state but 
 * post a message to the assigned native window handle and change the state 
 * when processing the message. 
 * <br> Errors and warnings can thus not be returned to the application directly,
 * the application will be informed via status change notification / callback.
 * 
 * The callback passes two parameters to describe the event: a major number and a
 * detail number. 
 * <br>These notifications are passed:
 * <br> Major reason for the event.
 *          - 1 An error occured
 *          - 2 A warning occured
 *          - 3 A information message
 *          - 0x400 a special event from eSignature Pad (Wacom SignPad)
 *          - 0x401 a special event from SOFTPRO TabletServer driver
 *          .
 * <br> Detail information for the event
 *      The value depends on the major event type:
 *          - 1 (Error):
 *              - @ref SP_NOPADERR The pad did not respond or was disconnected, application should terminate acquiry
 *              - @ref SP_CANCELERR aborted, only SPTabletServer driver, may be same as cancel button, application should camcel the operation
 *              - @ref SP_UNSUPPORTEDERR  unspecified internal error occured, only SPTabletServer driver, application should terminate acquiry
 *              - @ref SP_APPLERR  unexpected data is passed, only SPTabletServer driver, application should terminate acquiry
 *              - @ref SP_INVALIDERR  invalid configuration, only SPTabletServer driver, application should terminate acquiry
 *              .
 *          - 2 (Warning) currently not used
 *          - 3 (Information) currently not used
 *          - 0x400 (eSignature Pad, Wacom SignPad)
 *              - @ref SP_CRYPTERR Key negotiation failed, vector data is exchanged unencrypted
 *              - @ref SP_UNSUPPORTEDERR The tablet does not support encrypted data exchange
 *              - @ref SP_INTERR an internal error occured, unexpected tablet state, application should terminate acquiry
 *              - @ref SP_DIBERR wrong background image
 *              .
 *          - 0x401 (SPTabletServer)
 *              - @ref SP_DIBERR wrong background image
 *              - @ref SP_TIMEOUTERR  Timeout, no stroke after timeout mseconds, can be handled as OK button
 *              .
 *          .

/**
 * @page page_CTabletCreation Tablet creation options
 * 
 * Signware offers three options to create a tablet
 *  - TabletCreate: The TabletCreate function passes a driver id as the only parameter. This is the
 *    easiest method to create a tablet object, which is typically used if exactly one tablet is 
 *    connected to the host, or the application will use any tablet which may be found first.
 *    <br> These driver ID's are defined in SignWare:
 *      - @ref SP_UNKNOWN_DRV   access any driver
 *      - @ref SP_WINTAB_DRV    access a Wintab driver
 *      - @ref SP_PADCOM_DRV    access a MobiNetix driver
 *      - @ref SP_NATIVE_DRV    access a SOFTPRO native driver
 *      - @ref SP_TCP_DRV       access a SOFTPRO TCP driver
 *      - @ref SP_REMOTETABLET_DRV   access a SOFTPRO remote driver
 *      - @ref SP_TABLETSERVER_DRV   access a SOFTPRO TabletServer driver
 *      .
 *     <br>
 *  - CreateTabletEx: The CreateTabletEx function passes two parameters, a TabletClass and a 
 *    TabletConfiguration string.
 *    <br> These tablet class names are supported:
 *      - SPTabletHidDrv    interface to the SOFTPRO HID driver to access TabletPCs
 *      - SPTabletInterlink interface to the SOFTPRO Interlink driver (SWILUniv)
 *      - SPTabletMobinetix interface to Mobinetix driver
 *      - SPTabletStepOver  interface to StepOver BlueM and BlueM-LCD tablets
 *      - SPTabletTopaz     interface to Topaz 1X5, 4X3 and 4X5 SE LCD tablets
 *      - SPTabletWSignPad  interface to Wacom SignPad tablets
 *      - SPTabletWacom     interface to Wacom Intuos, Graphire, etc. tablets
 *      - SPTabletWTablet   interface to SOFTPRO eInk driver to access TabletPCs
 *      - SPTabletVerifone  interface to SOFTPRO driver to access Verifone Mx 800 series tablets
 *      - SPTabletTabletServer interface to SOFTPRO driver to access tablets via SOFTPRO TabletServer
 *      .
 *    Under Linux, only SPTabletWSignPad is supported.
 *    <br> <br> 
 *    Optional configuration data may be passed in the TabletConfiguration parameter.
 *    Configuration data equals the options as described in tablet.ini, depending on the 
 *    detected tablet model:
 *      - SPTabletHidDrv    no configuration parameters
 *      - SPTabletInterlink no configuration parameters
 *      - SPTabletMobinetix no configuration parameters
 *      - SPTabletStepOver  pass the contents of the file tablet.ini, see @ref pg_PadInstallation
 *      - SPTabletTopaz     pass the contents of the file tablet.ini, see @ref pg_PadInstallation
 *      - SPTabletWSignPad  pass the contents of the file tablet.ini, see @ref pg_PadInstallation
 *      - SPTabletWacom     no configuration parameters
 *      - SPTabletWTablet   no configuration parameters
 *      - SPTabletVerifone  pass the contents of the file tablet.ini, see @ref pg_PadInstallation
 *      - SPTabletTabletServer pass the tablet device identifyer
 *      .
 *    See @ref pg_PadInstallation for detailed information on configuration options for supported 
 *    tablets.
 *    <br> TabletCreateEx may be used to address a specific tablet if more than one tablet is
 *    connected to the host.
 *    <br><br>
 *  - CreateTabletByAlias: The CreateTabletByAlias function passes a TabletAlias string.
 *    <br> The TabletAlias is used as a lookup the windows registry to read a unified resource
 *    location description, which includes the TabletClass and TabletOptions to create the tablet 
 *    using TabletCreateEx.
 *    <br>Under Windows the ULOC will be located in the registry folder HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\SOFTPRO\\tabletconfig\\AliasName.
 *    <br>Under Linux the ULOC will be located in a configuration file ~/.config/SOFTPRO/tabletconfig.config
 *    in section [AliasName].
 *    <br> The Key ULOC contains a resource locator which describes the tablet class and 
 *    further configuration properties.
 *    <br> ULOC format: 
 *    <br>    sptablet://class=ClassName[&connection={usb|tcpip|com}]&[connection_value=port_id]&options
 *    <br> where
 *      - class contains the name of the tablet class, see @ref SPTabletCreateEx for a list of valid tablet classes
 *      - connection contains the interface used to connect to the tablet
 *      - connection_value contains a interface identifyer, e. g. '-2' for second USB device, 
 *        or '2' for COM2, or '192.168.1.15:1002' to address a tcpip interface
 *      - options contains a '&' separated list of options as defined in the tablet.ini, see @ref pg_PadInstallation 
 *      .
 *    The ULOC string must be an url-encoded string (e. g. '&' must be converted to its ansi value '\%38',
 *    a space ' ' must be encoded to '\%32').
 *    <br> CreateTabletByAlias is a convenience function with the same capabilities as TabletCreateEx
 *    but the application uses an alias that will finally be converted to the actual tablet creation 
 *    parameters based on information that is loaded from the registry on the host where the 
 *    application is running, and the tablets are connected.
 *  .
 * 
 * @section sec_CTypicalTabletCreation Typical Creation of a tablet
 * 
 * Most applications may assume that only one tablet is connected. The simple tablet creation
 * should thus satisfy most requirements.
 * <br> An entry in the tablet.ini (see @ref pg_PadInstallation) may be required to use an
 * externally connected tablet on a tablet PC.
 * 
 * Applications that must address more than one tablet should setup the Alias in the registry of
 * the client and pass an Alias for the desired Tablet.
 * <br> Example: let's assume that the application will sign a document. Both, the customer
 * and the consultant, have to sign the document. Two tablets are connected to the host, one
 * located at the customer side, and one located at the consultant side.
 * <br> It is recommended to add a tag to each signature field which defines the Alias used and 
 * to create the tablet object based on the Alias.
 * 
 @code (C)
int CreateTablet(pSPTABLET_T *ppTablet, const char *pszAlias)
{
    int rc = 0;
    if(pszAlias && *pszAlias) {
        rc = SPTabletCreateByAlias(ppTablet, pszAlias);
        // if the alias cannot be resolved then use any tablet found in the system
        if(rc == SP_INVALIDERR)
            rc = SPTabletCreate(ppTablet, SP_UNKNOWN_DRV);
    } else {
        // if no alias passed then use any tablet found in the system
        rc = SPTabletCreate(ppTablet, SP_UNKNOWN_DRV);
    }
    return rc;
}
 @endcode

/**
 * @page page_CTabletHardwareButtons Tablet Hardware button Assignment
 * 
 * Some Tablets integrate harware buttons. A callback function 
 * will be invoked when a hardware button is pressed. SignWare 
 * passes an identifyer for the hardware button that the 
 * application can respond appropriately. 
 * 
 * The hardware button identifyers are internally assigned:
 *   - StepOver blueM tablets:
 *       - 0: small button
 *       - 1: large button
 *   - Verifone MX 800 tablets:
 *       - 0: virtual button OK
 *       - 1: virtual button Cancel
 *       .
 *   - SPTabletServer devices:
 *       - 0: button OK
 *       - 1: button Cancel
 *       - 2: button Repeat
 *       - 3: button Shutter
 *   .
 * 
 * <br>
 * If the callback also passes a pressure value for the virtual button then the pressure 
 * will most likely equal the maximum pressure for the device (normalized maximum pressure: 1023).
 * 
 * Pressure values:
 *   - StepOver blueM tablets:
 *       - always 1023
 *   - Verifone MX 800 tablets:
 *       - always 1023
 *   - SPTabletServer tablets:
 *       - always maximum pressure level
 *       .
 *   .
 * 
 * <br>
 * Please note that you may have to explicitly register a listener for hardware button events.
